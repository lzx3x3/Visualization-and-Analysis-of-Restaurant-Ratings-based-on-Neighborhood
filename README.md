# Visualization-and-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Ratings-based-on-Neighborhood

The project "Visualization and Analysis of Restaurant Ratings based on Neighborhood" is a teamwork of 5 graduates. It is the final project of Gatech course cse6242 (Data Visual and Analytics). We collected user review data of Atlanta restaurants from yelp API, detected fake reviews by detecting abnormal days, analyzed correlation between rating and restaurant features/user information with random forest algorithm, and designed a web page of visualizing and filtering Atlanta restaurants on google map.
